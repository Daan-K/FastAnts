FastAnts
========

This is a Rust implementation of the simulator and visualizer for the ant language
used in 2004's edition of the [ICFP Programming Contest](https://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~plclub/cgi-bin/contest/)

To try it out, go to `ant_viz` and run `cargo run --release`. Note that you will
need the nightly version of the Rust compiler, as some unstable features are
used by the library.
